*A look of confusion by lead actor Natalie Portman that is somewhat relatable*

Annihilation is a Sci-Fi thriller which explores a weird phenomenon called *The Shimmer*. It starts with an impact from outer space on a lighthouse somewhere in the world, which eerily creates a oily colorful *shimmer* that has infected the space (and time?) and slowly metasticizing outwardly with no real cause.

*Like looking through the world reflected from a puddle of oil the shimmer makes things.. oily?*

Needless to say, oily space is not something humans approve of and so they have been sending investigative teams, primarily military to see what's up, however to no avail as everyone who goes into the Shimmer *never returns*...

With this knowledge, the best course of action is to send 5 random females dressed up as ghost busters into the shimmer as that might resolve the underlying mystery...
