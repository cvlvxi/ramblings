# 2020 or 1DC

It's the year 2020 or 1DC(During Covid). 

I guess before we get started with the whole blogging process it's necessary to speak to the situation we have all been struggling with. 

It started with an empty shelf of toilet paper:

Anxiety started to increase and spirits were at all time low and lockdowns, well they were a plenty:

In the midst of all this, in the midst of all the isolaton and the zoom calls and the incremental chipping away at work (if you indeed still have work), there was something that I feel was constant just like the speed of light in a vacuum of a single electron.

The pursuit of knowledge.

Okay... what?

There has been a lot of time to learn things and not enough ways to express what was learnt... so here's another one on top of the other forms (go check out the youtubez like and subscribe lawl) and potential others which I may or may not have discovered already. Also you may get ramblings related to reviews of bad movies and philosophical nonsense that is from a nonsensical person.

Enjoy.
