# Nim 

Yet another programming language like python that has C like performance (apparently!)

Let's explore what it can offer as there seems to be quite a few projects related to bioinformatics and nim!

## <a name='Links'></a>Links
- [My Playground](https://github.com/cvlvxi/nimplayground)
- [Official - Learn Nim](https://nim-lang.org/learn.html)
- [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble)
- [Norm: Nimble ORM](https://github.com/moigagoo/norm)

## <a name='Nimble'></a>Nimble 
- Nimble is like cargo for nim 
- Can specify build and test configuration
- See [Nimble Github](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble)

## <a name='ProjectStructure'></a>Project Structure

- How do I setup my nim prjoects like a cmake / meson project wiht multiple binaries
- Multiple .nimble files? 
- Let's take a look at [Project Structure](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#project-structure)
- src dir

`Warning: When source files are placed in a src directory, the .nimble file must contain a srcDir = "src" directive. The nimble init command takes care of that for you.`

### <a name='Creatingabinary'></a>Creating a binary
- [Binary Packages](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#binary-packages)

Add to the .nimble file by setting a value for the `bin` directive

e.g.

bin = @["main"]

- This looks for the file `main.nim` in the srcDir which you can set
