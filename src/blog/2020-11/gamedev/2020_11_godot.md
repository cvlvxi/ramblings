# Learning Godot Game Engine

I don't know why but this came to my mind when I see the word `godot`

<img src="https://imgur.com/lS1eBL7.png"/>

Godot is a pretty cool `game engine` written in c++. Like Unity Engine, it gives you the ability to add resources, assets and scripts and is cross platform.

Let's give it a go(dot).

## <a name='DGame'></a>2D Game

### <a name='Entities'></a>Entities

#### <a name='Howto:Addingsimplerectangle2dbody'></a>How to: Adding simple rectangle 2d body 
- A kinematic body can be used with 2D Collision
- Within 'othernode' under `KinematicBody2D`
- Needs a collision shape to detect the collisions with the world
- Add a `CollisionShape2D`

<img src="https://imgur.com/jnDeiXB.png"/>

- in the insepctor add `Shape: Rectangle`

<img src="https://imgur.com/4TuP9Je.png"/>

- Use the snapping tool to align Collision2DShape and player sprite 

<img src="https://imgur.com/91Xlz0E.png"/>

- Shift+G + pixel snap

#### <a name='CreatingaSceneScriptforthePlayer'></a>Creating a Scene & Script for the Player

We saved the Scene for the Player in `src/Actors/`

<img src="https://imgur.com/TSPs8FZ.png"/>

We will also associate a script for the player which will be stored here

<img src="https://imgur.com/afIa1U9.png"/>

#### <a name='ActorPlayerEnemyScripts'></a>Actor, Player, Enemy Scripts

Let's create a base class for the Actor that Player and Enemy will inherit from

```csharp
// Actor.cs
using Godot;
using System;

public class Actor : KinematicBody2D
{
	// Declare member variables here. Examples:
	// private int a = 2;
	// private string b = "text";

	// Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
	public override void _Ready()
	{
		
	}

	public override void _PhysicsProcess(float delta)
	{
		Vector2 velocity = new Vector2(300, 0);
		MoveAndSlide(velocity);
		base._PhysicsProcess(delta);
	}

	//  // Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
//  public override void _Process(float delta)
//  {
//      
//  }
}
```

Since we're inheriting from KinematicBody2D we have a method that we can override called `_PhysicsProcess`

This will be called every frame and will handle the physics collision stuff. We also are calling `MoveAndSlide` to move the Player

And Player.cs

```csharp
using Godot;
using System;

public class Player : Actor
{
	// Declare member variables here. Examples:
	// private int a = 2;
	// private string b = "text";

	// Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
	public override void _Ready()
	{
		
	}

//  // Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
//  public override void _Process(float delta)
//  {
//      
//  }
}
```

#### <a name='MovethePlayersceneintotheFrame'></a>Move the Player scene into the `Frame`

As you can see from the screenshots the player is not in the frame yet

<img src="https://imgur.com/ve7Hug4.png"/>

to here

<img src="https://imgur.com/4BFCnZ0.png"/>

Now our player will appear in the frame

#### <a name='Exportingvariablesintotheeditor'></a>Exporting variables into the editor

In Csharp you can use the `[Export]` directive above what you want to be exported into the editor

<img src="https://imgur.com/eHR3xYK.png"/>

Make sure to hit the `build` button so that it will appear in the editor

See below we now have `gravity`

<img src="https://imgur.com/Non9R7U.png"/>


#### <a name='ResetPlayertoOrigin'></a>Reset Player to Origin

<img src="https://imgur.com/0rOhfW2.png"/>

### <a name='LevelsTileSetTileMap'></a>Levels (TileSet/TileMap)

#### <a name='Creatingafloorlevel'></a>Creating a floor  / level

Creating a Floor or Level will use a `TileMap` so Create a new Scene

<img src="https://imgur.com/F3zOdns.png"/>

Import a tileset: `tileset.tres`. See the TileSet Format is a specific godot resource

or create your own tilesets in the editor

You can add tiles onto the tilemap by pressing `mouse1` and removing them by pressing `mouse2`

<img src="https://imgur.com/2HCLIju.png"/>

#### <a name='AddingcollisiontotheTilemap'></a>Adding collision to the Tilemap 

<img src="https://imgur.com/MJCvMzM.png"/>

#### <a name='Problem:CelldoesntfitonTilemap'></a>Problem: Cell doesn't fit on Tilemap?

- Let's change the Cell property 

<img src="https://imgur.com/F0Poiiz.png"/>

#### <a name='Addplayertolevelscene'></a>Add player to level scene

<img src="https://imgur.com/qJFKvl3.png"/>

Make sure that Player is a decendent of the Level rather than the TileMap

<img src="https://imgur.com/B9W5OIf.png"/>

#### <a name='NowruntheLevelsScene'></a>Now run the Levels Scene!

You should get this dialog to runt he Levels Scene 

<img src="https://imgur.com/wsR2Vg4.png"/>

and WALA!

### <a name='LayersPhysics...'></a>Layers (Physics...)






-----------------------------------------------------------

## <a name='Problem:NoAutocompletewithCandGodot'></a>Problem: No Autocomplete with C# and Godot 

Unfortunately godot's internal editor doesn't have autocomplete for C# and you need to use a different editor like vscode

See [Issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/24947)

Since we're big brained software devs let's use Rider by Jetbrains cos' why not


## <a name='Problem:DifferencesbetweenGdScriptandCsharpAPI'></a>Problem: Differences between GdScript and Csharp API

- [See here for differences](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/c_sharp_differences.html)

### <a name='Example:ExportinCsharp'></a>Example: Export in Csharp

The export keyword is used like such:


```csharp

using Godot;

public class MyNode : Node
{
    [Export]
    private NodePath _nodePath;

    [Export]
    private string _name = "default";

    [Export(PropertyHint.Range, "0,100000,1000,or_greater")]
    private int _income;

    [Export(PropertyHint.File, "*.png,*.jpg")]
    private string _icon;
}
```
