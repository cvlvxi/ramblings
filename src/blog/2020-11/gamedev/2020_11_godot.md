# Learning Godot Game Engine

I don't know why but this came to my mind when I see the word `godot`

Godot is a pretty cool `game engine` written in c++. Like Unity Engine, it gives you the ability to add resources, assets and scripts and is cross platform.

Let's give it a go(dot).

### <a name='Howto:Addingsimplerectangle2dbody'></a>How to: Adding simple rectangle 2d body 
- A kinematic body can be used with 2D Collision
- Within 'othernode' under `KinematicBody2D`
- Needs a collision shape to detect the collisions with the world
- Add a `CollisionShape2D`

- in the insepctor add `Shape: Rectangle`

- Use the snapping tool to align Collision2DShape and player sprite

### <a name='CreatingaSceneScriptforthePlayer'></a>Creating a Scene & Script for the Player

We saved the Scene for the Player in `src/Actors/`

We will also associate a script for the player which will be stored here

### <a name='ActorPlayerEnemyScripts'></a>Actor, Player, Enemy Scripts

Let's create a base class for the Actor that Player and Enemy will inherit from

```c#

Console.WriteLine("dog")
```

## <a name='Problem:NoAutocompletewithCandGodot'></a>Problem: No Autocomplete with C# and Godot 

Unfortunately godot's internal editor doesn't have autocomplete for C# and you need to use a different editor like vscode

See [Issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/24947)

Since we're big brained software devs let's use Rider by Jetbrains cos' why not
