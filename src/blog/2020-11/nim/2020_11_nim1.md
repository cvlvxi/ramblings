# Nim 

Yet another programming language like python that has C like performance (apparently!)

<img src="https://nim-lang.org/assets/img/twitter_banner.png"/>

Let's explore what it can offer as there seems to be quite a few projects related to bioinformatics and nim!

## <a name='Links'></a>Links
- [My Playground](https://github.com/cvlvxi/nimplayground)
- [Official - Learn Nim](https://nim-lang.org/learn.html)
- [Nimble](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble)
- [Norm: Nimble ORM](https://github.com/moigagoo/norm)
- [Advanced nim.cfg file](https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer/blob/master/nim.cfg)
- [Nimscript](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nims.html)

## <a name='Nimble'></a>Nimble 
- Nimble is like cargo for nim 
- Can specify build and test configuration
- See [Nimble Github](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble)

## <a name='ProjectStructure'></a>Project Structure

- How do I setup my nim prjoects like a cmake / meson project wiht multiple binaries
- Multiple .nimble files? 
- Let's take a look at [Project Structure](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#project-structure)
- src dir

`Warning: When source files are placed in a src directory, the .nimble file must contain a srcDir = "src" directive. The nimble init command takes care of that for you.`

### <a name='Creatingabinary'></a>Creating a binary
- [Binary Packages](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble#binary-packages)

Add to the .nimble file by setting a value for the `bin` directive

e.g.

bin = @["main"]

- This looks for the file `main.nim` in the srcDir which you can set

### <a name='Importingfromanotherfilemodule'></a>Importing from another file (module)

If you have another file `utils.nim`

which defines the following

```nim
proc dog*() =
  echo "I am doing something"
```

NOTE: That the proc has * after the name which allows it to be exported!

Then in another file you include it via:

```nim
import "foobar/utils"

echo "HelloWorld"

dog()
```

## <a name='NimCfg:Debugging'></a>Nim Cfg: Debugging
For extra configuration e.g. for debugging we want to specify some configuration stuff in a `nim.cfg` file

- [Example nim.cfg](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/devel/config/nim.cfg)

This is so the nim c compiler can be targetted to use lines like `debugger:on`	

I added the following to my nim.cfg file

```
--debuginfo:on
--lineDir:on
```

nim.cfg uses nimscript to parse it which is a `subset of nim`. See [nimscript](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nims.html)

Then running something like lldb:

```
lldb bin/ngip

(lldb) l
   2181
   2182 when not defined(js):
   2183   proc cmp(x, y: string): int =
   2184     when nimvm:
   2185       if x < y: result = -1
   2186       elif x > y: result = 1
   2187       else: result = 0
   2188     else:
   2189       when not defined(nimscript): # avoid semantic checking
   2190         let minlen = min(x.len, y.len)
(lldb) 
```
