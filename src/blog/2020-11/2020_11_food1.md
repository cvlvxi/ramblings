Yum Cha is an experience where one is served a medley of small dishes with tea. The dishes, also known as *dim sum*, arrive in a trolly of stacked wooden containers. Typically a single container contains 2 or 3 items which are shared amongst the table leaving behind a trail of wooden receipts and happy customers.

The dishes themselves are small but full of flavor. There's no masquerading as to what's what. Take for instance the iconic Har Gao, a full bodied prawn wrapped in a pillow of dumping skin. Try one and you'll be hooked for another... but wait there's more!
