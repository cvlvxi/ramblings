*As the conveyor belt of packaged delights moves across the table, you'll hear the familiar sound of `CHEW CHEW` from the happy customers feeding themselves from the sushi train's life source*

ALL BOARD! Buckle up kids as you're in for a treat. A variety of bites and nibbles stand a few feet away. The sushi train `回転寿司` or `kaiten zushi` offers a plethora of sushi and other items its customers. It's most commonly found in Japan, however recently its ventures have expanded internationally and there may be a train near you!

Whether alone or with companions, the experience is a metaphorical practice of absolute ZEN. The coach layout of the sushi train may seem a bit restrictive with patrons bunched up against each other. But the idea behind this is so you have direct access to the conductor, the sushi master who is there to take fresh orders and pass them to you directly. This is an alternative to possessing items from the train that may not be as fresh but still very edible.

*Typical California Roll*

Typically when people think of sushi they're thinking of the California roll, a seaweed wrap of salmon and avacodo popularized in California USA. There is way more variety to what you get at the sushi train and it's a great place to diversify you're awareness of sushi! For example you'll find the following at a typical sushi train:

*Nigiri*

A type of fish e.g. Salmon, tuna and different parts e.g. the fatty part or lean part on a bed of rice. This is best enjoyed with a dab of wasabi and a `small amount of soy sauce`.

*Sashimi*

The raw fish itself without the rice, also enjoyed in the same way as nigiri.

*Gunkan Maki Sushi*

More towards the California roll but more minimalistic. Like a combination of nigiri wrapped in a wafer thin seaweed layer.

*Tempura Chicken*

There's more than just fish though, sushi trains give an option for the non fish eater with chicken cooked better than Colonel Sanders.

And for the noodlers out there, they've got you with offerrings of FRESH udon which will warm you up on a cold winter's day.

## Tips and Tricks 101

### 1. Order from the Ipad

You'll definitely want to come in knowing how to use a gadget like an ipad as this is the general method for ordering fresh items directly from the kitchen. This has the advantage of 1. getting your items fresh but also 2. so you know exactly what you've ordered so you can tally up that potentially expensive bill. Oh did I mention that it'll be expensive. That's one big downside so go sparingly like once a month instead of once a day. 

### 2. Secret Ipad Game

Some sushi trains offer a secret game in the ipad that you can play and have 100% win rate. They generally offer something if you win like a free icecream so `JUST PLAY IT` and get that sweet dessert as a complementary gift and walk out like a boss.

### 3. Know some Japanese

Knowing some japanese goes a long way so here's a bit of Japanese 101.

Itadakimasu: `いただきます`

This basically translates to: *I'm ready to eat*.

Say this before your meal to impress the staff there and engage with them at a cultural level. This might enhance your experience by 10% as you'll be a curious customer ready to give it your all. 

Gochisousama Deshita: `ご馳走さま でした`

*I've finished eating*  (roughly translated)

You'll hear this a lot in Japan said outwardly after finishing a meal but it means more than that. The announcement of finishing a meal is polite and equivalent to an Italian mama seeing your fat belly after eating her pasta and living life to the fullest. So say it.
