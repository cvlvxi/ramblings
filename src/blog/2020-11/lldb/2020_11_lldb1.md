# LLDB

Debugging is an essential activity when programming. If LLcoolJ was a programmer, he would potentially use something like `gdb` or in as the title of this piece reveals... `lldb`.

*A happy llcoolj after figuring out the problem with lldb*

So let's explore a real life example and use cases of lldb such that if LLCoolJ in this universe or another were a programmer he would know what are the tips & tricks of the trade.


## <a name='Problem:Settingbreakpoints'></a>Problem: Setting breakpoints

Firstly remember to compile your code with -g for symbols or in Cmake you can do this with setting this in your CmakeLists.txt: `set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)`

Then you can specify a file:linenumber to break  on

```
(lldb) b 203
Breakpoint 1: where = example`::render_frame() + 29 at main.cpp:203:25, address = 0x00000001000029bd
(lldb) 
```

Then call run 

```
r
Process 18563 stopped
* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1
    frame #0: 0x00000001000029bd example`::render_frame() at main.cpp:203:25
   200  extern "C" {
   201      EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE
   202          bool render_frame() {
-> 203              HN::ItemIds toUpdate;
   204              HN::ItemIds toRefresh;
   205 
   206  #ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
Target 0: (example) stopped.
(lldb) r
```

## <a name='Problem:Seelocalvariables'></a>Problem: See local variables


Use: v to see all variables

```
(lldb) v
(HN::ItemIds) toUpdate = size=0 {}
(HN::ItemIds) toRefresh = size=0 {}
(bool) isActive = true
(lldb)
```

There are lots of commands under v which you can see by typing `help v`

```
(lldb) help v
     Show variables for the current stack frame. Defaults to all arguments and local variables in scope. Names of argument, local, file static and file global
     variables can be specified. Children of aggregate variables can be specified such as 'var->child.x'.  The -> and [] operators in 'frame variable' do not
     invoke operator overloads if they exist, but directly access the specified element.  If you want to trigger operator overloads use the expression command to
     print the variable instead.
     It is worth noting that except for overloaded operators, when printing local variables 'expr local_var' and 'frame var local_var' produce the same results.
     However, 'frame variable' is more efficient, since it uses debug information and memory reads directly, rather than parsing and evaluating an expression,
     which may even involve JITing and running code in the target program.

Syntax: v <cmd-options> [<variable-name> [<variable-name> [...]]]

Command Options Usage:
  v [-AFLORTacglrst] [-y <name>] [-z <name>] [-f <format>] [-G <gdb-format>] [-d <none>] [-S <boolean>] [-D <count>] [-P <count>] [-Y[<count>]] [-V <boolean>] [-Z <count>] [<variable-name> [<variable-name> [...]]]

       -A ( --show-all-children )
            Ignore the upper bound on the number of children to show.

       -D <count> ( --depth <count> )
            Set the max recurse depth when dumping aggregate types (default is infinity).

       -F ( --flat )
```

One useful one is to only see variables at a certain depth:

```
v -D 1
```


## <a name='Problem:Amoreuserfriendlyinterfacegui'></a>Problem: A more user friendly interface `gui`

Using gui allows you step through the code and also see things like your local vars at the same time

```
gui
```

Use tab to switch between source and variables 


## <a name='Problem:IneedmoreinfoVoltron:Viewstackregisters'></a>Problem: I need more info! (Voltron: View stack, registers)

Another useful tool is voltron which can be opened in a different terminal to view other useful information.

It will update as you step through lldb so it's nice to have it side by side.

You can get info about the disassembly, register vals, stack vals etc
