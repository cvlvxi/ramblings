Design a stock market such that AI's will `buy / sell` stocks for companies listed in the Artificial Stock Exchange

Different AIs will have `different strategies` of buying and selling which will create a `fluctuation in the market` i.e. companies prices changes

Initialization of the world & companies:

- Randomly generate companies with different prices
- Companies are obligated to pay `dividedends` this will have an impact on the AI strategy 

Paramterization of:

    - Different Stock AI Strategies
    - Different worlds: i.e. unlimited companies vs fixed companies

Strategies could be:

    - AI that needs to meet a certain $ threshold
    - Competitive / Adverserial AI 
    - Buyer AI
    - Seller AI 




## Design

### 1. Stock Ticker

Example ticker

| PRICE | DELTA (PRICE) | DELTA (%) | PRICE (NEW) | ...etc |
| ----- | ------------- | --------- | ----------- | ------ |
