*A look of confusion by lead actor Natalie Portman that is somewhat relatable*

Annihilation is a Sci-Fi thriller which explores a weird phenomenon called *The Shimmer*. It starts with an impact from outer space on a lighthouse somewhere in the world, which eerily creates a oily colorful *shimmer* that has infected the space (and time?) and slowly metasticizing outwardly with no real cause.

*Like looking through the world reflected from a puddle of oil the shimmer makes things.. oily?*

Needless to say, oily space is not something humans approve of and so they have been sending investigative teams, primarily military to see what's up, however to no avail as everyone who goes into the Shimmer *never returns*...

With this knowledge, the best course of action is to send 5 random females dressed up as ghost busters into the shimmer as that might resolve the underlying mystery...

Okay, REWIND, how did we get here?

The Shimmer dips in and out of the present, past and the future. We begin with Lena (*Natalie Portman*) being interviewed by a bunch of PPE'd Scientists being questioned about her time in the Shimmer. As she speaks about the finality of the events we are about to experience in the movie, we also see flashbacks to a happier time she had with fellow Star Wars rebel Poe Dameron *(Oscar Issac)* who plays her Husband and one of the military unit members who went missing in the Shimmer at some point.

But why did he go in? Surely he knew it was suicide? The flashbacks explore a confused Lena trying to deal with absence without knowing any of the details. Tortured, she paints the walls in her house and denies the chance of love from a colleague who happens to be married. (It turns out that he knew about the affair she was having with the colleague and hence why he went on this suicide mission but I didn't catch that until later)

Out of nowhere her husband appears, dazed and confused and suddenly collapses. Whilst being driven to the hospital he bleeds profusely from the mouth and then some unidentified officials, heavily armed capture him and take him and Lena away.

*Husbando is back well dressed like yakuza but seems too confused to know what clothes are*

So that's the plot driven element of the story and then we to entering the Shimmer.

The team enter the shimmer and it's like a psychedelical jungle where it's like the constrast level has been turned up to 100% on nature.

There's some pretty cool stuff like this deer plant thing.

Anyway long story short:

Turns out she was not Natalie Portman but the Shimmer version of Natalie Portman. And she meets up with her husband shimmer and they hug.

*See this eye thing? It's the shimmer I guess*
