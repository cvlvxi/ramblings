*As the conveyor belt of packaged delights moves across the table, you'll hear the familiar sound of `CHEW CHEW` from the happy customers feeding themselves from the sushi train's life source*

ALL BOARD! Buckle up kids as you're in for a treat. A variety of bites and nibbles stand a few feet away. The sushi train `回転寿司` or `kaiten zushi` offers a plethora of sushi and other items its customers. It's most commonly found in Japan, however recently its ventures have expanded internationally and there may be a train near you!

Whether alone or with companions, the experience is a metaphorical practice of absolute ZEN. The coach layout of the sushi train may seem a bit restrictive with patrons bunched up against each other. But the idea behind this is so you have direct access to the conductor, the sushi master who is there to take fresh orders and pass them to you directly. This is an alternative to possessing items from the train that may not be as fresh but still very edible.

*Typical California Roll*

Typically when people think of sushi they're thinking of the California roll, a seaweed wrap of salmon and avacodo popularized in California USA. There is way more variety to what you get at the sushi train and it's a great place to diversify you're awareness of sushi! For example you'll find the following at a typical sushi train:

*Nigiri*

A type of fish e.g. Salmon, tuna and different parts e.g. the fatty part or lean part on a bed of rice. This is best enjoyed with a dab of wasabi and a `small amount of soy sauce`.

*Sashimi*

The raw fish itself without the rice, also enjoyed in the same way as nigiri.

*Gunkan Maki Sushi*

More towards the California roll but more minimalistic. Like a combination of nigiri wrapped in a thin wafer seaweed layer.
