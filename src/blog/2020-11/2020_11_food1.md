# Delicacies Delicioso I

There aren't many things as self explainatory as the deliciousness that is Yum Cha (食點心).

Yum Cha is an experience where one is served a medley of small dishes with tea. The dishes, also known as *dim sum*, arrive in a trolly of stacked wooden containers. Typically a single container contains 2 or 3 items which are shared amongst the table leaving behind a trail of wooden receipts and happy customers.

The dishes themselves are small but full of flavor. There's no masquerading as to what's what. Take for instance the iconic Har Gao, a full bodied prawn wrapped in a pillow of dumping skin. Simple yet striking, try one and you'll want another.

Dumplings come in a variety of different ways. Typically you'll have a combination of the favored son, the prawn, combined with some other distant relation such as uncle pork and auntie scallop and ginger.

Feeling adventurous? Well for a regular patron of yum cha like myself, this is not something felt when dining on things such as `glutinous chicken feet, beef tripe, congee (porridge) with seasoned century egg`. No, these are the staples of yum cha one becomes familar with after a repeat visit and believe me when I say this: *don't knock it till you try it!*.

Ending the meal opens the door to a variety of dessert options, some of which are tragic like flavored jelly. But the most notable  dessert one can have is signature egg tart: a puff piece pastry that crumbles at the slighest touch and is followed by a smooth rich warm custardy eggy yellow substance one can assume is egg. Give this a go even if you are bursting at the seams with fullness, as it is the only way to end a meal at yum cha.
