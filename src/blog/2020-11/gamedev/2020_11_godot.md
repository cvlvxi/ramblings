# Learning Godot Game Engine

I don't know why but this came to my mind when I see the word `godot`

Godot is a pretty cool `game engine` written in c++. Like Unity Engine, it gives you the ability to add resources, assets and scripts and is cross platform.

Let's give it a go(dot).

## <a name='DGame'></a>2D Game

### <a name='Howto:Addingsimplerectangle2dbody'></a>How to: Adding simple rectangle 2d body 
- A kinematic body can be used with 2D Collision
- Within 'othernode' under `KinematicBody2D`
- Needs a collision shape to detect the collisions with the world
- Add a `CollisionShape2D`

- in the insepctor add `Shape: Rectangle`

- Use the snapping tool to align Collision2DShape and player sprite

- Shift+G + pixel snap

### <a name='CreatingaSceneScriptforthePlayer'></a>Creating a Scene & Script for the Player

We saved the Scene for the Player in `src/Actors/`

We will also associate a script for the player which will be stored here

### <a name='ActorPlayerEnemyScripts'></a>Actor, Player, Enemy Scripts

Let's create a base class for the Actor that Player and Enemy will inherit from

```c#
// Actor.cs
using Godot;
using System;

public class Actor : KinematicBody2D
{
	// Declare member variables here. Examples:
	// private int a = 2;
	// private string b = "text";

	// Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
	public override void _Ready()
	{
		
	}

	public override void _PhysicsProcess(float delta)
	{
		Vector2 velocity = new Vector2(300, 0);
		MoveAndSlide(velocity);
		base._PhysicsProcess(delta);
	}

	//  // Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
//  public override void _Process(float delta)
//  {
//      
//  }
}
```

Since we're inheriting from KinematicBody2D we have a method that we can override called `_PhysicsProcess`

This will be called every frame and will handle the physics collision stuff. We also are calling `MoveAndSlide` to move the Player

And Player.cs

```c#
using Godot;
using System;

public class Player : Actor
{
	// Declare member variables here. Examples:
	// private int a = 2;
	// private string b = "text";

	// Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
	public override void _Ready()
	{
		
	}

//  // Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
//  public override void _Process(float delta)
//  {
//      
//  }
}
```

### <a name='MovethePlayersceneintotheFrame'></a>Move the Player scene into the `Frame`

As you can see from the screenshots the player is not in the frame yet

## <a name='Problem:NoAutocompletewithCandGodot'></a>Problem: No Autocomplete with C# and Godot 

Unfortunately godot's internal editor doesn't have autocomplete for C# and you need to use a different editor like vscode

See [Issue](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/24947)

Since we're big brained software devs let's use Rider by Jetbrains cos' why not
